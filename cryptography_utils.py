#********************************************************************
#This module will be responsible for the encryption and decryption of your credentials. 
#Here, we will use Python's cryptography library.
#
#Before running your project, execute generate_key() once to generate your secret.key and 
#use encrypt_message() to encrypt your credentials. Store the encrypted values in config.json
